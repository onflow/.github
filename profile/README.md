# 🌊 Flow Blockchain
‍
Flow is a decentralized platform that anyone can access, everyone can trust, and no-one can censor or block. Leverage a fast and permissionless layer 1 blockchain to create limitless Web3 apps for mainstream adoption. 

Thanks to its unique, multi-role architecture, Flow is designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly environment, all whilst having some of the lowest transaction costs and environmental impact of any blockchain.

## Why Flow? 

- [Protocol level Account Abstraction](https://developers.flow.com/build/advanced-concepts/account-abstraction): Flow provides native support for key use cases that are enabled by Account Abstraction, empowering developers to deliver mainstream-ready user experiences like walletless onboarding.
- [Account linking](https://developers.flow.com/build/advanced-concepts/account-linking): Flow’s native Account Abstraction also makes it possible to share ownership over accounts. This allows apps to offer seamless user onboarding while letting users maintain secure (and self-custodial) asset ownership.
- [Multi-role architecture](https://flow.com/primer): Flow's node architecture allows the network to scale to serve billions of users without sharding or reducing the decentralization of consensus.
- [Resource-oriented programming](https://flow.com/post/resources-programming-ownership): an improved security model as well as a better user and developer experience. Smart contracts on Flow are written in [Cadence](https://developers.flow.com/build/cadence), an easier and safer programming language specifically designed for digital assets and apps. Cadence has a familiar syntax and uses a strong, static type system to minimize runtime errors, and allows all methods, interfaces, and transactions to include pre- and post-conditions to enforce expected behavior. This has resulted in a language that is easier to learn, significantly easier to audit, and ultimately much more productive than any current alternatives. 
- [Developer ergonomics](https://developers.flow.com/build/flow): Flow is designed to maximize developer productivity. Examples range from upgradeable smart contracts, native multi-sig support, and scripted transactions which allow a single transaction to interact with any number of smart contracts.
- [Native on-chain randomness](https://flow.com/post/on-chain-randomness-on-flow): randomness is hard, and it’s even harder on-chain. Flow introduces a breakthrough ‘randomness beacon’ which generates an unbiased, unpredictable, and verifiable source of secure pseudo-randomness in a fully decentralized manner. This is essential for things like Gaming, DeFi and prediction markets without needing to rely on external Oracles.
